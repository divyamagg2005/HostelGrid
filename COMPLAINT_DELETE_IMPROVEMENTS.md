# Complaint Deletion Page - Readability Improvements

## ✅ Changes Applied

### Problem
Text on complaint deletion confirmation pages had poor readability due to:
- Low contrast between text and background
- Insufficient complaint information displayed
- Small text in warning messages
- Unclear visual hierarchy

### Solution Implemented

Both deletion and resolution confirmation pages have been completely redesigned with:
- ✅ **High contrast text** - All text uses `text-dark` class for maximum readability
- ✅ **Light backgrounds** - `bg-light` on card bodies for better contrast
- ✅ **Complete complaint details** - Shows all information before deletion
- ✅ **Clear visual warnings** - Enhanced alert boxes with borders
- ✅ **Larger buttons** - `btn-lg` for better accessibility
- ✅ **Better spacing** - Improved layout with proper margins
- ✅ **Support for both admin and student views**
