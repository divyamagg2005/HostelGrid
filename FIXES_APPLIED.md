# Fixes Applied - View/Delete Buttons & Email Issues

## ✅ Issue 1: View and Delete Buttons Not in Single Line

### Problem
The View and Delete buttons in the student complaints list were appearing stacked vertically instead of side-by-side.

### Solution
Added `style="white-space: nowrap;"` to the Actions column in the student complaint list template.

### Files Modified
- `templates/complaints/student_complaint_list.html`

### Result
- ✅ Buttons now appear in a single horizontal line
- ✅ Matches the admin dashboard layout
- ✅ Changed View button to yellow (warning) to match your screenshot

## ✅ Issue 2: No Email Received After Submitting Complaint

### Problem
Emails were not being delivered to student inboxes after submitting complaints.

### Root Cause
The `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` was set to `noreply@hostelgrid.com`, but Gmail requires the FROM address to match your actual Gmail account (`projectsmatter85@gmail.com`).

### Solution
Updated email configuration in `settings.py`:
- Changed `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` from `noreply@hostelgrid.com` to `projectsmatter85@gmail.com`
- Added `SERVER_EMAIL` setting
- FROM address now matches your Gmail account

### Files Modified
- `hostel_management/settings.py`

### Test Results
- ✅ Test email sent successfully
- ✅ Email configuration verified
- ✅ All users have valid email addresses

### If Email Still Doesn't Arrive

4. **Verify Email**: Make sure the student's email in the database is correct
